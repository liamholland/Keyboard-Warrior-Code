## Basic-Game-System
A strong basis of a game system written back in 2020 for Unity, improves and builds upon the code in the InteractionSystem repository

### Features:
- Interaction System
- Player scripts such as stats and movement
- Combat system based around weapons and armour
- Enemies
- Items (similar to combat items) which can be collected from chests and viewed in an inventory
- Conversation System for NPCs

###### Many of these systems are built to allow easy development in the Unity Editor
